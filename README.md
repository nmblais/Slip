# Slip
A chess-variant, if I can say. 

The application is a frontend GUI for the game of Slip.

The program is an alpha released for windows written in C++ (version 11) and compiled using Visual Studio 2015.

SMFL and TGUI libraries are used for the graphics and the GUI.

There is a reame.txt file explaining the rules of the game. How to use the application should be intuitive enough.
The first thing to do after starting the application, is to go to the option menu and select a playing mode 
(computer vs computer, for instance.) Then, from the South and North menu, respectively, select an engine.
The radio button on the right of the game board should show that each engine will take one second per move for 
calculation. Finally, from the option menu, select the item "go" and watch the two engines playing each other.
The game moves are recorded next to the game board while the game is in progress. Once the game is finished,
to start another game, go the file menu and select "New". "Exit" will stop the program.

This a test version that plays one starting prosition out of eight.
